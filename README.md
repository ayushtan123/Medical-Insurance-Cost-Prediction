# Medical Insurance Cost Predictor

## Description:
The Medical Insurance Cost Predictor is a Python application that utilizes logistic regression to estimate medical insurance costs based on a set of input features. This project is implemented using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, scikit-learn, and pandas, making it easy to understand and extend.

## DataSet

The dataset has 6 input features and one target -> charges.

We split the data into train and test (80-20 split) to make sure the LR is able to generalize well to unseen data.

## Features:
- Logistic Regression: The core of the predictor is built on logistic regression, a machine learning algorithm suitable for binary classification tasks.

- NumPy: Efficient numerical operations are handled using NumPy, ensuring fast and optimized computations.

- scikit-learn: The scikit-learn library is employed for building, training, and evaluating the logistic regression model.

- Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing tasks are simplified with the use of Pandas, providing a convenient interface for handling datasets.
